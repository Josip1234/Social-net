How to choose environment env? how much check do we need?

1.) First check if there is any user as local databas user. 
If not, call error there is no local users. please, use initial script of database.
Second check - if user count is > 0 check if user is social_admin. If it is not
social_admin, call error there is no admins as local database user. Please 
use initial sql script to add it. 

2.) Before number of users, need to check account type dana. Needs to be minimal 2 records.
If there is no minimal 2 records, call an error minimal two records  must be in account type.
Then check the values. If First check has been passed, check the values. Two values must be 
in database: Admin and Regular. If there is no values with specific values, call an error.
There must be Admin and Regular values in account table. Please add them. Use dml script to add
account types.

3.) After checks from number 1 has been finished, check number of users in profile.
If user count > 0, second check will be in procedure. Otherwise call error 
minimum one user must be in database. If that check was successfull, check then 
if user is social_admin. Need to check user account in table user accounts. If that
user is not social_admin, call error at least 1 profile must be admin in social_net database, 
in profile registered. 

4.) If check has been succeded, you can login First as admin. After login, account will be set to be active. 
From now on, when user is being registered, user will have regular environment instead social_admin.Need to see
it would be better if default env shoud be regular?

5.) After user has been logged in, check user type. If type is regular, after all the previous checks, set env variable
to be regular.
